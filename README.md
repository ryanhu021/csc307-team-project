  - On Windows: `npm run lint-fix` after each `git pull`

- Run Locally:
  - frontend setup
    - `npm start -w frontend`
  - backend setup
    - `npm run dev -w backend`
- Build Locally:
  - `npm run build -w fronted`
  - `npm run build -w backend`

- Test Locally:
  - `npm test`
  
- Making changes:
  - make a new branch off dev: `git checkout -b branch_name` from the dev branch
    - main is the production code and dev is the working code
  - make appropriate changes
  - to merge:
    - `git add changed_files` or `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "appropriate message"`
    - `git push -u origin branch_name`
    - make a pull request to be approved. Make that the build workflow completes

## Contributing:
- Root ESLint:
  - uses recommended rules to enforce best practices and common rules for typescript
  - extends prettier's configurations: uses prettier's code formatting rules in ESlint
  - results in error level ESLint issue if code formatting does not comply with prettier's formatting
  
- backend:
  - extends root ESLint configuration
  
- frontend:
  - extends root ESLint configuration
  - plugins: "react" and "react-hooks" to enforce styling specific to react and react-hook

- automatic configuration:
  - the settings.json file has workspace ESLint configurations so contributors do not need to manually configure it
    - automatically formats on save.

- Linter Setup Instructions:
  - VSCode:
    - Navigate to "Extensions" page (Ctrl + Shift + X)
    - Search for "Prettier - Code formatter" by Prettier
    - Install
    - Search for "ESLint" by Microsoft
    - Install

- Scripts 
  - (use -w=frontend or -w=backend for a specific workspace)
  - npm run lint: checks code for styling and formatting issues using ESLint and Prettier and issues will be reported
  - npm run lint-fix: checks code styling and formatting issues using ESLint and Prettier and fixes them for all.
